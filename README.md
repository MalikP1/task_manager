task_manager

Task manager is a program allowing a user to add a task, view a list of all tasks, mark a task as completed and exit the program. Building this program allowed me to practise using a virtual environment, PEP 8 compliance, buidling a modular program and unit testing, deepening my understanding of coding in Python.
